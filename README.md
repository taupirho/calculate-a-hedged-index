# calculate-a-hedged-index

Letâ€™s assume that on a daily baisis you calculate and store the total return of an index in some currency, say US 
dollar (USD) terms. You now want to create/calculate a new index based on it but hedged in a forward currency 
(e.g HKD) over a specific time period e.g 3mths is an industry standard. 
 
We assume we have a database table **INDEX_DHIST** that contains a time series of daily Total Return values for our 
established index in whatever base currency terms e.g US dollars. We also assume we have a daily history of 
both spot and required forward cross rates for the required forward currency **curr** contained in a database 
table called **CURR_RATES**

The Oracle PL/SQL in this repository shows the calculation required. It should be reasonably starightforward to convert to 
other database systems and languages
